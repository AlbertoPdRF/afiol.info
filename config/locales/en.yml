      title: "About me"
      introduction_title: "Introduction"
      introduction_p1_html: "I'm Alberto Pérez de Rada Fiol. Born in Mallorca (Balearic Islands), Spain, in 1994, I've always been an active guy trying to make the most out of every experience in life. I lived in Mallorca for my first 18 years after which I moved to Madrid to pursue my university studies: first a Degree in Physics, followed by a Master of Science Degree in Nuclear Physics, and since 2017 I'm pursuing a PhD in Experimental Nuclear Physics at the Research Centre for Energy, Environment and Technology (<a href='http://www.ciemat.es' target='_blank'>CIEMAT</a>, by its initials in Spanish)."
      introduction_p2: "But not everything is studying! The hobby I have enjoyed the most, to the point that I can say it has changed my life, has been Speedcubing. Besides, I've always loved playing sports; since I was 8 years and until I was 15 I spent every weekend sailing with my Optimist, and basketball has brought to me many good times. Reading fantasy books is another one of my pleasures; I got late to the party, but when I started I couldn't stop. I'm also interested on web development."
      physics_title: "Physics"
      physics_p1: "Since early in school I got very interested in Maths. Studying such subject in depth made me grow thinking analytically and develop my problem-solving skills. When later on I discovered Physics I became amazed by how vast our universe and the laws governing it are, and that made me take the decision to pursue a Degree in Physics. I can't say it was an easy journey or that I always enjoyed it, but I can definitely say I don't regret having took that decision. Well into the degree the Nuclear Physics field caught my attention to the point of signing in to the Nuclear Physics Master of Science Degree."
      physics_p2_html: "When diving into the Nuclear Physics field I became especially interested in Experimental Nuclear Physics, particularly in Neutron and Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy, and I got to learn a lot from the half-year internship at CIEMAT to work on my End of Master Dissertation, titled \"Characterization and simulations of a CLYC detector for gamma-ray and neutron spectroscopy\". Later on I got a 4 years Predoctoral Researcher contract at CIEMAT to work on my PhD, which consists of Nuclear Structure measurements with the MOdular Neutron SpectromeTER (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nds.2014.07.011' target='_blank'>MONSTER</a>)."

      speedcubing_title: "Speedcubing"
      speedcubing_p1_html: "I have a great hobby which I can gratefully say it changed my life. I learnt how to solve the Rubik's Cube on late 2009, and since then I haven't stopped! I got to know the World Cube Association (<a href='https://www.worldcubeassociation.org' target='_blank'>WCA</a>) and its competitions soon after starting timing myself solving the puzzle, but I couldn't attend my first competition until 2011. Since then, I have attended more than 50 competitions and podiumed more than 300 times on all events that the WCA recognizes combined. Among these podiums the most prominent ones are my 5 Spanish Champion titles -- 3 of 3x3x3 With Feet and 2 of Pyraminx. Those titles together with my 11 National Records are my greatest achievements competition-wise."
      speedcubing_p2_html: "However, for me the most important part of the Speedcubing world is its community, and getting into it has been an awesome, unrepeteable experience. I started voluteering for the community by organizing competitions -including the <a href='https://euro2018.cubecomps.com' target='_blank'>WCA European Championship 2018</a>-, and later on being appointed as a WCA Delegate on late 2016. Soon after that I became a WCA Regulations Committee member. On late 2017 I applied to the WCA Board of Directors and got elected by the organization Staff for a 2 years term, during which I'm also serving as the WCA Secretary. Sitting on the Board of Directors of a worldwide organization has thaught me many things and has made me grow immensely, and that's something I'll always be thankful for."

      activities_title: "Activities"
      activities_p1: "Playing any kind of sport has always been a pleasure for me, but especially two of them have really left their mark on me: the first one being sailing and the second one being basketball. I spent most of the weekends of my childhood sailing with my Optimist, training when I wasn't competing, but always enjoying it. I got to participate quite a few times in the Balearic Islands Championship, and it was overall a nice experience which allowed me to make many friends and get to know the islands where I come from better. When growing up I became more and more interested in basketball, and although I never played for a team, I can say I had a blast improving my game with some university friends. Not only playing basketball is funny, but watching it is too! Ever since I saw Game 7 of 2010 Finals I've loved seeing NBA games; being able to see playing Kobe Bryant first and Stephen Curry later has been delightful for me! And, being Spanish, I of course like playing and seeing football too, especially Real Madrid games."
      activities_p2: "Reading books has also been a source of joy for me, especially fantasy ones. The first great saga I read was The Lord of the Rings and it caught me. However, the one I fell deep in love with was A Song of Ice and Fire, the remaining books of which I can't wait to read (as many more people out there I bet). Harry Potter also touched me and I enjoyed every single chapter of it. Seeing movies and TV series is a good entertainment for me. Apart from, obviously, the adaptations of my favorite books, I enjoy action and comedy so much, as well as some good thriller every now and then, my favorite movie being The Godfather."
      activities_p3: "Besides, I'm self-learning web development since some time ago. I mostly contribute to open source, Speedcubing-related projects, and also coded this website from scratch. Almost everything I've learnt so far is Ruby on Rails, which I have to say has been a pleasure to learn thanks to its good documentation and the support of many friends. I look forward to making more progress on this exciting new journey!"
